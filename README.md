Objectives
1. Generate a simulated dataset of stock values employing Geometric Brownian Motion, and subsequently compute call option prices through the utilization of the Black-Scholes model.
2. Construct Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurring Unit (GRU) models, and conduct training to facilitate the assimilation of the Black-Scholes model for the creation of a predictive framework.
3. Execute web scraping procedures to extract data from Yahoo Finance, thereby acquiring real-world figures from the S&P500 equity options market.
4. Apply the previously trained neural network (NN) model to prognosticate call option prices within the collated dataset, subsequently assessing its efficacy in the context of real-world data sets
